***
This tool produce GammaRay maps for annihilation and decay of dark matters.
The input could be a tipsy file or nativefile.
The inputs includes the the particle possitions, particle density, particle hsmooth, and particle velocity dispersions. These quantities are calculated by "smooth" code.

To convert the tipsyfile to native file, use the tool in dataconverter.

Note:
    This tool only deal with dark matter particle, even in the simulation has baryonic particle, it only use dark matter particle to calculate the annihilation/decay rate.



*_cuda_* are only for CUDA

3 method for producing the all-skymap.
-- -CUDA:
   make cuda-all:
        Produce all skymap by method of super pixels.
        First use a healpix map of lower resolution, with those super pixel calculated, calculate the which smaller pixel is in which super pixel. After that, do perform the calculation.

-- -CUDA-RENDER:
   make cuda-render:
        Maybe a better method. Used shared memory to copy the particles,
        used other fancy CUDA-technology
