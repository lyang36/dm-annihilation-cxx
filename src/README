*_cuda_* are only for CUDA

3 method for producing the all-skymap.
-- -CUDA:
   make cuda-all:
        Produce all skymap by method of super pixels.
        First use a healpix map of lower resolution, with those super pixel calculated, calculate the which smaller pixel is in which super pixel. After that, do perform the calculation.

-- -CUDA-RENDER:
   make cuda-render:
        Maybe a better method. Used shared memory to copy the particles,
        used other fancy CUDA-technology
